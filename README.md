# SequentialAndMultiProcess


The subject of this project is to calculate the standard deviation of two separate files with sequential and multi-process program and compare the runtimes of sequential and multi-process program and see the effect of using multi-process program on the programâ€™s runtime. 

In the sequential program, we put the numbers in the files into two arrays and calculated the summation of two files. After, we put all the numbers into one array and calculated the standard deviation of the numbers. Lastly, we printed the standard deviation and printed calculation time of the sequential program in milliseconds.
